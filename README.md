E-commerce website


Since I have lost job it's time to work on my portfolio. I always wanted to have a website where I could sell my crafts so here it is, I am going to be my own customer and these are my requirements:

Make it in:
- Vue.js
- SCSS
- No jQuery or Bootstrap (I have used these frequently in past I want to fiddle with JS and I have came across few applications where I have been asked to not work with Bootstrap)
- No idea about backend because I don't really know much of backend, that's something to think about in the future

It should be:
- Responsive
- Cross browser compatibile
- With excellent UX/UI
- With accessibility in mind
- Web optimised- make it fast

Make it:
- Make it fast
- Make it cheaply
- Make it well
