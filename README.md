E-commerce website


Since I have lost job it's time to work on my portfolio. I always wanted to have a website where I could sell my crafts so here it is, I am going to be my own customer and these are my requirements:

Make it in:
- Vue.js
- SCSS
- No jQuery or Bootstrap (I have used these frequently in past I want to fiddle with JS and I have came across few applications where I have been asked to not work with Bootstrap)
- No idea about backend because I don't really know much of backend, that's something to think about in the future

It should be:
- Responsive
- Cross browser compatibile
- With excellent UX/UI
- With accessibility in mind
- Web optimised- make it fast

Make it:
- Make it fast
- Make it cheaply
- Make it well



# Diary:


## Day 1 - 17 June 2020
Researched options, what should I use? Choice was between Anguar, React and Vue. Picked Vue due to it's simplicity and flexibility. Also from job search perspective, it's easy to transition to Angular or React if needed.
Made a quick wireframe of the front page

## Day 2 - 18 June 2020
Started the project abnd added SCSS to it. Made a rough long term plan and more detailed plan for the front page.
